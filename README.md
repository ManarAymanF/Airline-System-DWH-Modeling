# Airline-System-DWH-Modeling
A leading airline company engaged our services to support the executive management in their analysis of current business processes and identification of new opportunities for company growth.

 Project Description:
- Executives decided that the first deliverable should focus on the flight activity in order to ensure a good ongoing business process.
- The marketing department wants to analyze what flights the companyâ€™s frequent flyers take, what fare basis they pay, how often they upgrade, how they earn and redeem their frequent flyer miles, whether they respond to special fare promotions, how long their overnight stays are, and what proportion of these frequent flyers have gold, platinum or titanium status.
- Your analysis shall also include the reservation process where the finance team will be interested in analyzing the company's profit. Note that reservation processes can take place through multiple channels. The airline company also provides customer care interaction before, within, and after your trip in order to handle customer inquiries, and complaints and keep their feedback for business enhancements. Analysis should include interaction type and problem severity (if an issue exists) State the processes for your company then apply your modeling technique/s with a demonstrative layering methodology to design the logical and physical design to support such kind of analysis for decision support.

ðŸ–¥ Project Requirements

    State the modeling process for each business process.
    Construct a logical data model for this Project using any diagramming tool you like. The output should be an image or PDF. State why did you choose this particular     data model design? What does the data represent? (Details about each model component are necessary).
    Translate the logical data model to a physical data model which includes the following: tables, columns (name, data type), primary indexes, and foreign indexes,        and state why these types of indexes are used for each column. The output should be an Excel file.
    Create a table/s in oracle DBMS and populate sample data for your queries.
    Construct a sample of SQL queries (5 â€“ 8 queries) using your physical model design which can be used to answer possible questions by the decision maker as             described in the Project above. List the business question with each query. The output should be a Word file.
    
# What we have done in this project: 
 
  In order to execute this and distribute those reports to other business sectors inside the organisation we first considered how many business processes we would require. We came to the conclusion that there would be 3 processes involved in asking all the questions after far too many talks.
  1) Customer Care is crucial for gathering feedback from customers and learning about their preferences so we can improve our services.
  2) The Behavior of the passangers includes information about the passenger's behaviour as well as details about the ticket, the passenger, the flight, its route, and any promotions that may have been included.
  3) The trip's goal is to give the executive a full report on the state of the company's operations.
 
 We succeeded in defining the dimensions that will enable us to characterise various aspects of the business once we had completed putting the procedures in place.
 We will construct many models, including the bus matrix, the dimensional model, the logical model, and the physical model.
 We start building the model on the DBMS after finishing all of that and all the relations, adding some dummy data, and running five SQL queries to extract information from the data.
